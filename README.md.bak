# Netplanner

Proof of concept playbooks and roles to take a simple inventory and generate
a larger inventory that can be leveraged by the ansible-netplan role.

Network configuration can be applied via ansible once a machine is bootstrapped
with bifrost.

## todo

1. Remove existing netplan configuration file(s) before performing `netplan apply`
